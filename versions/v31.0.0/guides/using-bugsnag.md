title: Using Bugsnag
---

[Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) monitors application stability, so you can make data-driven decisions on whether you should be building new features, or fixing bugs.

Bugsnag notifies you of crashes and errors that your users experience and aggregates them on a dashboard. Reported issues include sourcemapped stacktraces and any other relevant context (device id, platform, Expo verison, etc.) automatically.  See [here](https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/react-native/automatically-captured-data/) for automatically captured data. You can also add any additional metadata to your error reports that help troubleshoot the issue like customer name, user id, or experiment information.
